# Smart_Irrigation_System
Using Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation
# Project Overview
This project simulates a Smart Irrigation System using Cisco Packet Tracer, designed to automate water distribution using basic IoT components. The system monitors water levels and controls sprinklers intelligently, ensuring efficient irrigation and water conservation. A smartphone interface allows users to monitor and manually control the system remotely through a simulated home gateway.

# Key Objectives
Monitor the water level in the reservoir/tank.

Automatically control sprinklers based on water availability.

Allow remote manual control via a smartphone.

Demonstrate IoT-based automation using minimal components.

#Components Used
Water Level Monitor: Detects whether the water tank has sufficient water.

Smart Sprinklers: Act as actuators to irrigate the field.

Home Gateway: Simulates a local server or cloud connection for device communication.

Smartphone: Used to remotely monitor and control the sprinkler system.

# System Workflow
The water level monitor constantly checks the water tank.

If water is available, the smartphone can be used to turn the sprinklers ON or OFF via the home gateway.

If the water level is low, the system will prevent sprinkler activation to conserve water.

The home gateway manages the communication between the sensors, actuators, and smartphone interface.

# Project File
smart irrigation system 2.pkt
→ Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file with full irrigation logic and devices configured.

# How to Run
Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.0 or higher).

Click on the smartphone and open the IoT Monitor/Control App.

Monitor the water level status.

If water is sufficient, activate the sprinklers from the smartphone interface.

Observe the sprinkler activation and system behavior.

# Features & Benefits
Minimal hardware simulation with meaningful IoT logic.

User control via smartphone enhances flexibility.

Prevents water wastage with level monitoring.

Fully offline simulation — ideal for learning & demonstration.
